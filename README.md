# Pan-cancer analyses of Centrosome Amplification
Here are the scripts (in R markdown format, .Rmd) and necessary files to reproduce the results presented in the paper [Pan-cancer association of a centrosome amplification gene expression signature with genomic alterations and clinical outcome](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006832).
